#+Title: A Simple S5 example
#+Babel: :results silent

* quick start
1. jump to the last heading/slide in this Org-mode file
2. evaluate the emacs-lisp code block which defines the
   =org-export-as-s5= command
3. call =M-x org-export-as-s5=
4. open the resulting page in your browser

* what is S5
- [[http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/][S5]] is "A Simple Standards-Based Slide Show System".

- S5 packages a presentation as a slide show and turns the web browser
  into the display software.

* what is this
- A customization of Org-mode's html export to generate a valid S5
  presentation.

- Thanks to Pierre de Buyl's [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/33143/match=s5][very thorough instructions]] the
  implementation of an =org-export-as-s5= function was fairly
  straightforward.

* where's the code
- The code is available [[file:org-export-as-s5.el][here]].

- Simply evaluate this code, or add it to your =.emacs=, then call
  =M-x org-export-as-s5= form within an Org-mode buffer. *Note*: the
  [[file:ui/]] directory holding S5 support files must be located in the
  same directory as the exported html.

- Currently there are three themes which can be set with the
  following.
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq org-s5-theme "railscast")   ; based off `color-theme-railscasts'
    (setq org-s5-theme "default")     ; the default S5 theme
    (setq org-s5-theme "i18n")        ; the i18n theme by the author of S5
  #+end_src

- This entire directory is available as a [[http://gitweb.adaptive.cs.unm.edu/org-S5.git][git repository]].
